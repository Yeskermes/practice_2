-Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
-Bonus: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What We learned
We have learned how to use all these tools correctly. How to correctly prioritize when compiling a website. You can see important examples below.

Snippets:

html
            <div>
                <p>Annually</p>
                <label for="timeframe-toggle" class="timeframe-toggle" tabindex="0">
                    <input type="checkbox" id="timeframe-toggle">
                    <span class="slider"></span>
                </label>
                <p>Monthly</p>
            </div>

css
#timeframe-toggle:checked + .slider {
    background-color: Linear-Gradient(90deg, hsl(240, 75%, 85%), hsl(240, 65%, 65%));
}

#timeframe-toggle:checked + .slider:before {
    transform: translateX(1.5em);
}
